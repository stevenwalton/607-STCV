\section{Conclusion}
In this survey we have seen some of the most popular types of generative models
and learned about some of their uses. Each form of generative model has
different advantages and disadvantages. We saw that GANs were great at producing
high quality and realistic images by directly learning how to generate images
and not concerning themselves with things like learning the likelihood of a
function. We saw that autoencoders and VAEs are simple to construct but are not
as powerful in their reconstructions. Lastly we saw how normalizing flows can be
used to learn the density function and in turn can be used to trivially infer
between different latent variables.
